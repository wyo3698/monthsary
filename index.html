						<h2>The Start: 09 AM, 09/09</h2>
						<p>On that unforgettable morning, I woke up with a mix of excitement and nerves, unsure of what the day held for us. Little did I know that she had already started getting ready, her own excitement palpable through a text she sent me. It was a heartwarming surprise and a reassuring sign that our feelings were reciprocated.

							Throughout the day, my nerves were ever-present, but her presence made every worry melt away. She looked stunning, and I made it a point to remember every detail of what she wore, not just for the sake of it but because I knew that this was the beginning of something truly special.

										<h3>Bouquet</h3>

									<p>To gift a bouquet was a given, so when it came to choosing the perfect flowers to express my feelings, I wanted something as unique and beautiful as the connection between us. That's why I opted for unicorn roses. These whimsical blooms, with their magical swirls of color, felt like the perfect representation of our vibrant and extraordinary journey together. Just like our love story, these unicorn roses stand out from the ordinary, showcasing the beauty of being different. They are a symbol of the special bond we share, and a reminder that our love is as enchanting and unique as these blossoms.</p>

										<h3>Lipstick</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My colleagues at work had a clever idea for your gift, to order a lipstick online and let you choose your favorite color. But here's the funny part: the lipstick hasn't arrived yet, even though you've already left for university abroad. I imagined you wearing that bright plum-red shade, and maybe even accidentally staining my shirt with it because I know how much you love your lipsticks. While the gift itself is still on its way, it's the thought and the anticipation that matter most. This unexpected twist adds a touch of humor to our story, reminding us that love can be full of delightful surprises.</p>

								<h3>My Feelings</h3>
								<p>Since seeing you on Myo Pa's story, I kept up with you on social media, feeling a connection that I couldn't quite explain. Fear and uncertainty held me back from approaching you, but fate had other plans. When I finally mustered the courage to approach you, I was hit with this wall of a casual "Sry for late rp, i'm ingame so". Our first interaction didn't quite go as planned, but little did I know that this amusing beginning would set the stage for the most extraordinary journey of my life. </br>
								</br>
									In just one short month, we've experienced a depth of love that I never expected to find so quickly. It feels as though we've shared a lifetime of laughter, adventure, and growth in this short span of time. Our bond has grown remarkably strong, and I couldn't be happier about it.</br>
								</br>
								Even though we're now separated by miles and time zones, I hold an unwavering belief in our love. I trust you completely, and I know that we can make this long-distance relationship work. It's a testament to the depth of our connection and the strength of our commitment to one another.
								</p>

							<div class="col-6 col-12-narrow">
								</br>
								</br>
								<p>What's even more remarkable is that our connection goes beyond love; we are, without a doubt, soulmates. Our thoughts align, our energy levels sync, and our personalities harmonize seamlessly. It's as though we were designed for each other, two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together. With you, I've found a kindred spirit, a partner who understands me in ways no one else ever has. Our similarities in thought, energy, and personality are a testament to the cosmic alignment that brought us together.</br>
								</br>
									I'm grateful for you every day, and I eagerly anticipate the countless beautiful moments we'll continue to share on this remarkable journey of love and discovery. As we celebrate this first milestone, I'm filled with excitement and hope for our future together. I look forward to creating more memories, overcoming challenges, and deepening our connection as we embark on this incredible adventure. With you by my side, I know that every day will be a new and beautiful chapter in the story of us.
